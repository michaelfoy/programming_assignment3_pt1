Description

The purpose of this task was to correctly utilise inheritance in Java classes and to provide test classes to demonstrate it's implementation. This project was developed using the eclipse IDE. It consists of descriptions of different shapes, all of which inherit properties from a parent class. 

Instructions
------------

1. Create a new java project in eclipse, within the src folder create a package called **util** and add the util.java file. 

2. Create another package called **ie.wit.ictskills.shapes** in the src folder, to this add all other .java files.

3. Import the ellipsemeasure.jar file by right clicking on the project folder then following `Build Path/Configure Build Path/Libraries/Add External JARs`. Then choose the ellipsemeasure.jar file.

4. The project is ready and the following classes can be executed from within eclipse:

* MaximumPerimeter.java
* TestPentagon.java
* TestShapes.java
